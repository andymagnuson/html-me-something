                     The Republic of Georgia is a country full of rich history and culture located in the mountains south of Russia and east of Turkey. Being located at a strategic crossrodes between Europe and Asia, Georgia has been host to nearly every major empire. Officially a Christian nation since the 4th centery, it is the second oldest Christian country in the world. It's currency, Gel, is equal to roughly .3 &#8364. I spent a year living amongst the Georgian population and have come to realize that 
                     Georgia is my favorite (non-American) country in the world because of it's food, people, and landscape.

                    In my opinion, the most important thing to a country's culture is it's food. By this standard, Georgia has a fantastic culture
                    If you like bread, meat, cheese, and booze, you are in luck. Sorry vegans :( Some common Georgian foods are Mtsvadi (pork belly), khinkali (juicy Georgian dumplings), and khatchapuri (Georgian cheesy bread). Georgians consider themselves the 
                    home of wine. Becaus of this, nearly every family outside of the capital city grows their own grapes
                    and makes their own wine and vodka. Supras--Georgian feast--last around 8 hours and usually involve members drinking 
                    5 to 6 litters of wine per person. Heaven.

                    Georgia is beautiful by any and all standards. Nestled in the Caucas mountains, wild and often harsh landscapes present themselves 
                    at every turn. 1600 year old churches litter the tops of nearly every mountain. The western side of the country is on the Black Sea. But really the country is all about mountains and rivers. Beautiful.

                    Georgians believe that guests are a gift from God. Because of this, they have an 
                    incredibly hospitable culture. While living there, I often hitchiked and never once
                    had to find a place to stay. Without fail, someone would pick me up, take me to their house,
                    and then invite their neighbors over to celebrate. Also, the women are beautiful
